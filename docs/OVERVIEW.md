LCT is a collection of command-line tools.

Most tools are independent and can be used individually, but some rely on others to function properly.
These dependencies are automatically handled by LCT-Manager.

## LCT-Manager

LCT-Manager is a central tool for installing, updating, and managing the LCT tools.
